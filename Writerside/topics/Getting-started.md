# Getting started

Aisle is a markup language and transpiling tool that aims to
be as simple and straightforward as possible when creating
architectural diagrams. Unlike other solutions it has very
simple and natural syntax, which makes it easier to start
and then understand your diagram.


## Install Aisle

Installing Aisle is as easy as typing the following in your
terminal:
```shell
pip install aisle
```
The only requirement is that you already have Python 3.12+ 
and pip installed.
