# File structure

Aisle files have the following structure:
```
<project definition>

<scope definition>
<scope definition>
<scope definition>
...
```

The project definition is as follows:
```
scope project <project name>
```
or
```
scope project <project name>:
    <project description text>
```

Exactly one project must be defined at a given .aisle file.
